# SignupForm
This project focuses on creating a sleek, responsive Sign Up form for a web application. Using
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, the form will emphasize strong client-side validation to
enhance user experience and safeguard data integrity. It ensures real-time feedback for user
inputs and restricts submission until all validations are successfully met.
